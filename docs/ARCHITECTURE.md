## System Overview

FlashFusion is built as a modern single-page application (SPA) with a clear separation between frontend presentation and backend services.

### Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Components are self-contained and reusable
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout for compile-time safety
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports multi-tenancy and high load
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and documentation
